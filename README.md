This is the solution to the Appium exercise and the Selenium exercise.

There is two package with the solutions:

**"com.appium.cucumber":** Contains the solution of the Appium exercise. I create two test cases to validate the access to the app, and te other one to validate that the sign-in button is not enabled with passwords with length off five or less.

**"com.selenium.cucumber":** Contains the solution of the Automation with Selenium/Cypress exercise. I use Java with Selenium in this case so i can automate the whole workflow. Also, I do the same exercise with Cypress in another branch.
